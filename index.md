## Welcome to Software Engineering Guide

> *How to be a professional software engineer without a formal education?* 

> *SEG is here to help!*

**Software Engineering Guide (SEG)** is a self-learning roadmap with a curated list of high-quality and free-of-cost learning resources in software engineering domain. SEG is a role-based guide that is organized into specialized learning paths. SEG covers the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) knowledge domains that represent the most popular working roles related to software engineering. Each learning path has an overview section and a set of structured online learning resources that are organized into four levels: foundation, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each level has a variety of online learning resources that are categorized into three types: MOOCs, webinars, and others. These learning resources are collected from highly-respected and well-trusted sources.

### Motivation

The motivation behind building this guide is the existing gap between the knowledge and skills that are acquired from traditional education offerings and the ones that are demanded today by industry--especially at the places with a low-quality education. However, nowadays, with the availability and affordability of internet connection, you can easily gain a free-of-cost access to high-quality learning resources from around the world. *Therefore, there is no excuse to say that I don't have a quality education!*

### Principles

To be a professional software engineer, you have to guide yourself by adopting some important principles, including ambition, passion, focus, self-motivation, self-learning, and seriousness. Without such principles, it would be very difficult to be in a mastery level of software engineering.

### Framework

The SEG is inspired by a framework that combines three essential components to develop a professional software engineer, including learner (acquiring technical and non-technical skills), methodology (adopting lean, agile, and DevOps), and technology (using next-generation technologies, such as ALM, IoT, cloud computing, etc.).

### Knowledge Areas

The SEG is mainly developed based on the main knowledge areas of software development lifecycle (SDLC) included in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge ([SWEBOK V3](https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3)). Furthermore, these knowledge areas are mapped to the most popular software engineering related roles available today in the industry.

### Learning Paths

The SEG includes ten different role-based learning paths (specializations). SEG provides guiding information and learning resources for each learning path. In addition, each learning path is associated with a LinkedIn group to facilitate the knowledge sharing and professional networking.

### Interpersonal Skills

Technical skills are not enough for a professional software engineer! In today working environments, soft skills are imperative and not less important than technical skills. Furthermore, developing business and establishing a tech start-up need an additional skill-set in entrepreneurship.

### Learning Process

To get a full advantage of this guide, it is highly recommended to first select a role from the specialized learning paths listed above. Then, begin the following process: learning, practicing, networking, and teaching. This process is overlapped, iterative, and should be a life-long journey to have effective knowledge and skills.

![](Slide9.JPG "Methodology") 

- **Learning**: a self-learning process to increase the learner's knowledge based on available online resources. The learner can leverage the collected resources available in this guide for each specialized role. These collections contain up-to-date, high-quality, and free-of-cost online learning resources. In addition, they will be kept updated with latest relevant content.

- **Practicing**: using software tools and technologies to improve the learner's skills. The learner can utilize open source software tools and also can gain a trial/free access to some commercial software tools to apply the acquired knowledge.

- **Networking**: joining and connecting with professional specialized online communities. This allows the learner to keep updated with latest trends and technologies in his/her specialized knowledge areas. Moreover, the learner can ask and communicate with experts in case he/she has an inquiry or encounters any difficulty.

- **Teaching**: to help in getting serious, sharing knowledge, and improving soft skills. Once the learner knows that he/she has to teach others about what he/she has learned, this definitely makes him/her more serious in his/her learning process. Additionally, through this process, the learner can practice and gain non-technical (soft) skills like confidence, communication, presentation, speaking, etc.

### Learning Outcomes

| Level        | Description           | Outcome  |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| **Foundation**     | Explains how to learn and provides an overall background about software engineering | Understanding the importance of self-learning and having an idea about software engineering in general |
| **Beginner**     | Focuses on the basic knowledge and skills of a particular specialization (learning path) |   Understanding the fundamentals of the selected learning path |
| **Intermediate** | Focuses on agile approaches and application life-cycle management (ALM) software | The ability to develop prototypes (partially functioning software) using an agile approach and ALM software |
| **Advanced** | Focuses on next-generation technologies (e.g. internet-of-things and cloud computing) and DevOps      |    The ability to develop next-generation applications (fully functioning software) using cloud computing and DevOps approach |

### Performance Measurement

It is very important for any software engineer to measure his/her progress towards his/her learning objectives and career path. From a practical perspective, this can be achieved by different means (achievment-based), such as delivering a technical presentation, demonstrating a piece of a developed prototype or a fully functioning application, or acquiring a professional certification in a particular domain.
