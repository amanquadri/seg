## Welcome to Software Engineering Guide

Software Engineering Guide (SEG) is a curated list of high-quality and free self-learining materials in software engineering domain. SEG is organized into specialized tracks (role-based) that cover the entire software development life cycle (SDLC) and represent the most popular working roles related to software engineering. Each track has a set of learning resources that are organized into four levels: foundation, basic, intermediate, and advanced. Each level has three categries of learing resources: MOOCs, webinars, and others.

### Learning Outcomes

| Level        | Description           | Outcome  |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| **Foundation**     | Explains how to learn and provides an overall background about software engineering as well as a guidance to your selected career path | Understanding of the importance of self-learning, and having an idea about software engineering in general and the selected career path |
| **Basic**     | Focuses on the basic knowledge and skills of a particular specialization (track)     |   Understanding of the fundamentals of the selected learning path |
| **Intermediate** | Focuses on agile approaches and application life-cycle management (ALM) tools      |    The ability to develop prototypes (partially functioning software) using an agile approach and ALM tools |
| **Advanced** | Focuses on next generation technologies (e.g. internet-of-things and cloud computing) and DevOps      |    The ability to develop next-generation real applications (fully functioning software) using cloud computing and DevOps approach |
