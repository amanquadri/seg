## Welcome to Software Engineering Guide

Software Engineering Guide (SWEG) is a curated list of high-quality and free self-learining materials in software engineering domain. This guide is organized into specialized tracks (role-based) that represent the most popular working roles related to software engineering. Each track has a set of learning resources that are organied into four levels: foundation, basic, intermediate, and advanced. Each level has three categries of learing resources: MOOCs, webinars, and others.

### Spcialized Tracks
